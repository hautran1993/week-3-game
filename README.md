Here is a hangman game, the known issues are occuring in the setWordBlank function especially through lines 69- 80. 

My hopes for the future are to turn this into a functioning application, and stylizing it in a comical manner with hilarious Nicolas Cage references.

According to resources like jshint.com, there aren't bugs in the code, but I have been unable to verify the functionality of the gameEndHandler due to the issues with the lines mentioned above.
